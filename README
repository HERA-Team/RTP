Still v2
TODO:

* Add support for _do.py and _do.pl scripts as well

* Make TaskServer go through all obsnums in database that are assigned to it and clean up
  any that were abandoned  - might not need to as scheduler should do this..
  
* Be careful if a neighbor is added in after the fact, should try and find what the neighbors are

* Check free disk space for data_dir, make sure it doesn't go below 10% free or some such

Prereqs:

pip install configparser
