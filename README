Still v2
TODO:

* Add support for _do.py and _do.pl scripts as well

* Make TaskServer go through all obsnums in database that are assigned to it and clean up
  any that were abandoned  - might not need to as scheduler should do this..
  
* Be careful if a neighbor is added in after the fact, should try and find what the neighbors are

* Check free disk space for data_dir, make sure it doesn't go below 10% free or some such

* Want better recovery, be able to pop severs out easily and know the exact ramifications and if its been too long
   we should just start the task over again on a new server, assuming the still has nothing better to do
   
* Check that path to log file and data directories exist

* Add support for environment variables to be passed to tasks and setup in config file

Prereqs:

pip install configparser
conda install sqlalchemy
conda install MySQL-python
