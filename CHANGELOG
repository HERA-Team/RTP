v2.0
New Feature List

Major:

* UDP connections were replaced by TCP for better handling of communications between scheduler and server

* There now exists a common interface for starting/stopping the Still scheduler and servers. This also serves as a unified 
   handler of all config file and command line argument parsing
   
* The hardcoded Paper workflow was removed and replaced with a config file definable workflow

* Brought all code up to standard PEP8 compliance and Python3 standards

* New AutoDiscover interface for handling Still servers allowing servers to be added and removed while the scheduler remains online 
   without the need to configure any at the start
   
* High load handling, the scheduler now checks that a Still server has recently checked in and that its load is below a threshold

* Dynamic load handling for new obsids, as new obsids are added they, along with their neighbors, are intelligently handed off 
   to the server with the lowest level of activity.
   
* Support for the PostgreSQL database added

* Path structure updated to conform to normal Posix standards allowing for more rapid deployment and updates

* Scheduler can now properly communicate with servers to kill tasks that have exceeded the timeout period



Minor/Bugfixes:

* Neighbor support has become a config file option

* Moved to a date format system that can handle dates other than Julian

* Fixed issue where multiple of the same processes could be executing

* Performance improvements related to SQL queries pulling down less extraneous data to process through  

* Greatly enhanced exception handling

* Better recovery handling, tasks will recover to the server they were previously on even if the list of servers changes
